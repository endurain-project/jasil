"""Scheduled retention pruning for the substrate's append-only bookkeeping tables.

The event_log (F7) and durable-job (F8) tables are append-only: every event
writes an ``event_log`` row, the relay stamps ``event_outbox`` rows, and each
``(event, subscriber)`` pair produces a ``processing_jobs`` row. Left alone they
grow without bound — and activities, the highest-volume event producer, fill them
fastest. This module prunes rows past their retention window on a schedule
(``EVENT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`` for the event_log trail, ``JOBS_RETENTION_DAYS`` for
the durable-job tables — each configured and disabled independently), deleting
only what is safe to lose:

* every ``event_log`` row (best-effort, safe-to-lose observability trail),
* relayed ``event_outbox`` rows (already fanned out into jobs), and
* ``completed`` ``processing_jobs`` rows.

In-flight and human-actionable rows are never touched: unrelayed outbox rows
(pending relay), ``pending`` / ``claimed`` jobs (in-flight work), and
``dead_letter`` jobs (kept for operator review). It runs single-runner across
replicas via the platform ``LockProvider`` and is inert when both windows are
``<= 0`` (retention disabled — keep every row forever).
