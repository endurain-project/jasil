"""Startup capability report and deployment-consistency checks.

Renders how each infrastructure capability (state, storage, events, lock,
clock) is wired for a human-readable startup log, and detects fatal
inconsistencies — a deployment that *requires* a shared backend but resolves
one to a process- or node-local implementation.

Two consistency rules are enforced:

- **Cross-process backends** — ephemeral *state* (rate-limit, auth-security,
  MFA, websocket tickets) and the *event* bus — must not resolve to
  process-local memory when the topology requires shared state (the
  ``distributed`` profile or more than one web worker); the stores/bus would
  diverge silently across processes. Both share the ``memory://`` / ``redis://``
  vocabulary and are validated by :func:`check_state_consistency`.
- **Cross-node storage** must not resolve to the local filesystem under the
  ``distributed`` profile, where replicas run on separate nodes with no shared
  disk. A multi-worker *local* deployment shares one host disk, so local
  storage stays valid there. Validated by :func:`check_storage_consistency`.
- **The coordination lock** must not resolve to the in-process ``noop`` lock
  whenever the deployment runs more than one process (the ``distributed``
  profile or any multi-worker deployment), or every process would run every
  scheduled job. Validated by :func:`check_lock_consistency`.

The *clock* is always the system clock, so its default is never a fatal choice
here.

Pure module — imports only ``jasil.profile``. The actual logging is
performed by the caller (``main.startup_event``) so this stays side-effect free
and trivially testable.
