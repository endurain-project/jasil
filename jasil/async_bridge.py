"""Bridge for dispatching async work onto the main event loop from sync code.

Synchronous code cannot ``await``. Two situations in this backend need to run
genuinely async I/O from a synchronous context:

* a synchronous FastAPI route, which Starlette runs on a threadpool worker thread
  (no running event loop of its own), and
* an in-process event-bus subscriber, which runs inline on whatever thread called
  ``publish`` (a request thread, the scheduler, or a durable-job worker).

When such code must perform async I/O — pushing a websocket message is the
motivating case — it hands the coroutine to :func:`dispatch`, which schedules it
on the **main** event loop captured at application startup via
:func:`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`. This keeps the async work on the one
loop that owns the resources (e.g. the websocket connections) while letting the
producing code stay fully synchronous.

The main loop is a process-wide handle (like the platform handle in
:mod:`jasil.runtime`), so it lives in a module-level slot set once from the
lifespan startup and cleared on shutdown. This module imports nothing from the
domain layer or any backend, so it is safe for any module to depend on.
