class StorageProvider(Protocol):
    """Opaque byte-blob storage addressed by a key within a named *area*.

    An area is a domain-owned namespace (e.g. ``"avatars"``, ``"exports"``) so
    one backend serves every subsystem: locally it maps to a subdirectory, on S3
    to a key prefix. The database stores only the key (the area is a fixed
    constant of the calling domain); ``url`` is computed at serialization time so
    migrating local -> S3 needs no data migration.

    Most subsystems only ever write a blob and later serve it via ``url``, but
    some need the bytes back in-process (e.g. bundling stored files into an
    export); ``get`` is that read path, returning ``None`` when the blob is
    absent.

    ``list_keys`` exists for the subsystems whose keys are *not* derivable from a
    domain id — for instance when a key carries a random component. Without a
    prefix listing, such a subsystem would have to reach past the provider to the
    filesystem to clean up after a deleted record, which is exactly what this
    provider exists to prevent.

    ``expires_in`` is **best-effort, and the one place the backends genuinely
    differ**: ``s3://`` returns a presigned URL that stops working when it
    elapses, while ``local://`` returns a plain path for the host's own web
    server and cannot expire at all — JASIL does not run that server and holds no
    key to sign with. Do not rely on the lifetime for authorization unless you
    know the deployment uses object storage; on local disk, restricting the URL
    prefix is the host's job. The local backend logs a warning the first time it
    is handed a non-default value.
