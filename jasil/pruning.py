"""Bounded batch deletes shared by the substrate's prunable tables.

Every table :mod:`jasil.retention` prunes (``event_log``, relayed
``event_outbox`` rows, ``completed`` ``processing_jobs``) is deleted the
same way, and only the model and the filter differ. The batching is what
keeps each delete transaction short, so a prune pass never holds locks on
a hot table long enough to block the relay or the worker.
