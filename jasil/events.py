"""The event envelope, ``new_event`` helper, and standard metadata keys.

Pure module — the single structured shape every event travels in, so the
pipeline can route, trace, correlate, dedup, and retry without knowing the
domain.

Channel names (``event_type`` values) are **owned by the domain that publishes
them**, not defined here — e.g. the activities module owns ``activity.created``.
Keeping them out of the substrate stops this generic layer from accumulating
domain knowledge; a producer and its subscribers import the same domain-side
constant so they cannot drift on the string. Convention: ``<domain>.<fact>`` in
past tense. ``event_type`` stays a plain ``str`` on the envelope so the bus is
open to new events with no edits here.

The envelope is defined ahead of the bus so the wire format never
has to change once the first producer ships.

Payload versioning
------------------
``schema_version`` describes the shape of ``payload`` for its ``event_type``. It
lives on the envelope rather than inside each payload dict so the substrate can
carry it without parsing domain data, and so no producer can forget it.

It exists because the code that *writes* a payload and the code that *reads* it
are not guaranteed to be the same version: a durable event is staged in the
outbox, relayed on a schedule, retried with backoff, and may sit dead-lettered
indefinitely — and during a rolling deploy old and new replicas run at once. A
consumer that silently ignores unknown keys (every payload model sets
``extra="ignore"``) would read a renamed or repurposed field as its default and
do the wrong thing quietly. The version turns that into something a consumer can
detect: see :mod:`jasil.event_versioning`.

The number is owned by the publishing domain, like the channel name. Bump it in
the domain's publisher when the payload's shape or a field's meaning changes;
purely additive optional fields do not need a bump.
