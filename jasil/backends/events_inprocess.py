    """Synchronous ``EventBusProvider`` — ``publish`` runs subscribers inline.

    Correct for the ``local`` profile: dispatch is a direct function call in the
    same thread, and a handler exception propagates to the caller (the scheduler
    backfill is the safety net). ``start`` / ``stop`` are no-ops because there is
    no background consumer.

    When an :class:`~jasil.providers.EventRecorder` is injected, each
    ``publish`` records the event's lifecycle (published -> completed/failed)
    around the inline dispatch in two writes: the intermediate ``processing``
    state is skipped because dispatch is synchronous and single-process, so that
    state is never observed. A handler exception is recorded as a failure and
    then re-raised, preserving the propagate-to-caller contract.
