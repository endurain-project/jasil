"""Redis Streams ``EventBusProvider`` backend.

Only imported by the composition root when ``events_uri`` selects Redis, so
``local`` deployments never load it. Publishing
is an ``XADD`` onto one stream; a background consumer thread reads through a
consumer group (``XREADGROUP``) and dispatches each event to the subscribers
registered for its ``event_type``, acking (``XACK``) after the handlers run.

A deployment normally ships one image, so every replica registers the same
subscribers. A single consumer group therefore gives "each derived computation
runs once per event across the cluster" (competing consumers), while in-process
fan-out to all handlers of an ``event_type`` still happens on whichever replica
claims the entry.

Delivery is at-least-once: an entry is acked only after its handlers succeed, so
a failed handler (or a malformed envelope) leaves the entry pending rather than
dropping it. This bus is the *best-effort* delivery path and has no in-bus retry
or reclaim of its own: an entry orphaned by a crashed consumer (which would need
``XAUTOCLAIM``/``XPENDING`` to recover) stays pending. For at-least-once delivery
with per-subscriber retry, backoff, dead-letter, and replay, enable durable jobs:
publishing then routes through the transactional outbox and ``processing_jobs``
instead of this bus, and each subscriber's own reconciliation sweep is the
safety net.
