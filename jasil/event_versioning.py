"""Version-aware payload parsing for durable and bus subscribers.

A subscriber never calls ``Model.model_validate(event.payload)`` directly; it
goes through :func:`parse_payload`, which compares the envelope's
``schema_version`` against the version the local code understands and does the
right thing for each direction of skew.

Why the direction matters
-------------------------
The writer and the reader of an event are frequently **not the same build**: an
event is staged in the outbox, relayed on a schedule, retried with exponential
backoff, and can sit dead-lettered indefinitely — and during a rolling deploy old
and new replicas serve traffic simultaneously.

* **Older event, newer consumer** (the common case — the outbox backlog after a
  deploy). This must actually work, so the payload model registers an explicit
  *upgrader* per version step. Silently defaulting a missing field is exactly the
  failure mode this module exists to prevent: every payload model sets
  ``extra="ignore"``, so a renamed or repurposed field would otherwise be dropped
  and read as its default, producing a wrong result with no error anywhere.
* **Newer event, older consumer** (a new replica publishes before the old workers
  drain). Nothing sensible can be done — the local code has never seen this
  shape. :class:`UnsupportedEventVersionError` is raised so the existing job
  machinery retries with backoff; the condition is self-healing, because by the
  time the attempts are spent the stale worker is normally gone. Failing loudly
  and retrying is strictly better than guessing.

No new machinery is needed for either: durable handlers already raise on failure
and the runner already retries and then dead-letters.
