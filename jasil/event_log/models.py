class EventLog(Base):
    """
    One row per event, recording its full processing lifecycle.

    Written exclusively by the event bus (never by domain handlers) so the
    system leaves a queryable trail: what was published, whether it was
    processed, by which worker, how long it took, and why it failed.

    Attributes:
        id: The envelope ``event_id`` (UUIDv4 string); stable across retries
            so it also serves as the deduplication key.
        event_type: The domain-event channel, e.g. ``order.created``.
        event_source: Where the event originated, e.g. ``api:create_order``.
        event_payload: The domain payload, passed through untouched.
        event_metadata: Correlation context (request_id, plus any host-defined keys).
        status: Lifecycle state — published, processing, completed, failed, or
            dead_letter for bus-delivered events; queued (terminal) for events
            handed to the durable job queue.
        handler_name: The subscriber(s) that processed the event.
        worker_id: The process/consumer that handled the event.
        error_message: The failure reason when status is failed/dead_letter.
        retry_count: Processing attempts so far; 0 on first publish.
        processing_time_ms: Handler execution time in milliseconds.
        created_at: When the event was published.
        processed_at: When a consumer picked the event up.
        completed_at: When processing finished (success or failure).
