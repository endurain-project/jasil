"""The event-log recorder — persists event lifecycle to the event_log table.

Implements the :class:`~jasil.providers.EventRecorder` protocol. The
composition root injects one instance into the event bus when
``event_log.enabled`` is set. Each write opens its own short-lived session and
swallows/logs any storage error, so a database hiccup never breaks event
processing — observability is best-effort by design.
