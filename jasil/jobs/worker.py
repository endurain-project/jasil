"""The worker loop that drains the durable job queue.

``run_worker`` is the blocking claim/run loop used both by the standalone worker
entrypoint and by :class:`BackgroundWorker`, which runs it on a daemon thread so
a single-process (``local``) deployment can process durable jobs without a
separate container. Reaping expired leases is a scheduled job, not part of this
loop.
