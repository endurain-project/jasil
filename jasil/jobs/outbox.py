"""CRUD for ``event_outbox`` — the durable-delivery staging table.

``add_to_outbox`` persists an event and commits it on the caller's session. Note
that the ingestion path commits per-CRUD, so this is *not* one transaction with
the domain change — the domain row is the source of truth and each subscriber's
reconciliation net (backfill/sweeper) recovers anything dropped by a crash
between the domain commit and the outbox write. ``list_unrelayed`` and
``mark_relayed`` are used by the relay; combined with the idempotent job fan-out
(dedup on ``event_id + subscriber_id``) and ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``,
that makes concurrent relayers safe and re-relaying a row harmless.

    """
    Persist an event to the outbox on the caller's session.

    With ``commit=True`` (default) the write is committed immediately. Callers on
    the ingestion path pass ``commit=False`` so the outbox row is only flushed and
    joins their open transaction — the domain change and the outbox row then commit
    together (atomic delivery; see :func:`jasil.publisher.publish_committing`).
    When committed independently (the historical best-effort seam), the outbox
    write is *not* atomic with the domain change, so a crash between them can drop
    the event and the subscriber's reconciliation net is the safety net.

        event: The event envelope to persist.
        now: Current instant (the outbox write time).
