"""Wiring for durable job processing — worker lifecycle and scheduled maintenance.

Consumed by ``main`` (start/stop the in-process worker) and the scheduler (relay
the outbox into jobs; reap expired leases). The relay, reaper, and worker all run
on every process and coordinate through ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` plus
the idempotent job fan-out (dedup on ``event_id + subscriber_id``), so replicas
scale horizontally without a single-runner lock — duplicate work is skipped or
deduplicated rather than serialized. All of this is inert unless ``JOBS_ENABLED``
is set.
