"""CRUD for ``processing_jobs`` — the durable, database-as-truth work queue.

**Internal.** Not covered by the API-stability contract, and it reaches a model
at import time, so it cannot be imported before ``jasil.orm.map_models`` has run.
Hosts wanting the dashboard aggregates or dead-letter replay should use
:mod:`jasil.admin`, which is importable from anywhere and opens its own session.

**Every function here commits the session it is given** — except where a
``commit`` flag says otherwise (``enqueue_job``, for the relay's single-
transaction fan-out). The claim, the terminal state writes and the reaper all
have to be durable before the caller moves on, so they are not optional. Pass a
session JASIL owns, not one carrying a caller's uncommitted work.

Every query is portable, so the same code runs on PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite.
The claim takes ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` wherever the dialect
supports it (see :func:`jasil._core.dialects.supports_skip_locked`) so concurrent
workers never grab the same row; where it does not, the clause is omitted and a
single worker is still correct. Callers pass an explicit ``now`` (from the
``ClockProvider``) so lease, backoff, and reaping are deterministic under test.
