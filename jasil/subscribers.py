"""Helpers for writing event-bus subscribers.

Every domain subscriber in the codebase is written twice: a raising core (the
durable-job handler, so the runner can retry and eventually dead-letter) and a
swallowing wrapper (the bus subscriber, so a derived-work failure never breaks
the producing request). :func:`best_effort` is that wrapper, defined once here
instead of being copy-pasted per subsystem — which previously meant each copy
could drift in what it logged and which exceptions it caught.

    """Wrap a raising event handler into a swallowing bus subscriber.

    The returned subscriber logs and absorbs **any** exception, so derived work
    can never fail the request or consumer that produced the event. The wrapped
    handler stays available for durable-job registration, where failures must
    propagate to drive retry and dead-lettering.

    Usage::

        def do_work_for_event(event: Event) -> None: ...

        on_event_do_work = best_effort(do_work_for_event)

    Args:
        handler: The raising handler to wrap.

    Returns:
        A subscriber with the same signature that never raises.
