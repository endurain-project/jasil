"""The single publish seam every producer goes through.

One tiny facade so no producer ever assembles an :class:`~jasil.events.Event`
or touches the active platform directly. Centralising publishing here means the
transactional outbox is a change to *this* function alone,
not to every call site.

It resolves the active platform, stamps the ambient request id for correlation,
and mints the envelope. Delivery then takes one of two routes:

* **Durable (outbox):** when durable jobs are enabled, the caller supplies its DB
  session, and the event type has registered durable subscribers, the event is
  written to the ``event_outbox`` — the relay later fans it out into retryable
  per-subscriber jobs. The event is also recorded ``queued`` in ``event_log`` so
  the observability dashboard reflects durable events too (execution detail then
  lives in the Jobs dashboard).
* **Best-effort (bus):** otherwise the event is dispatched through the event bus
  (inline in ``local``, via Redis Streams in ``distributed``), which records the
  full lifecycle itself.

**Delivery guarantee.** The producer's domain row is the source of truth; this
publish is *best-effort* from the producer's perspective — failures are logged and
swallowed so publishing never breaks the producer's own work. The outbox is not
committed in the same transaction as the domain change (the ingestion path commits
per-CRUD), so a crash between the domain commit and the outbox write can drop an
event. Every subscriber must therefore have a reconciliation net — a backfill or
sweeper that re-derives missed work). A future unit-of-work refactor can upgrade this to a genuinely
atomic outbox; until then, "durable" means *retryable once written*, not *never
lost*. Channel names and payload shape stay owned by the publishing domain; this
layer only knows the generic envelope.
